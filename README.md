# gapd
Auto Package Downloader for GoLang

## What is this?
I wanted to automatic "go get" for others. So make this.

## Installation & How to use?
1. Download `gapd` file. (Currently, it is only for mac. But if you want, download this project and build for your os. If this project's star will be good, then i will add for more os and more function.)
2. Run `gapd` commands.
3. It have just 3 commands.
   1. `~/path/gapd init` then gapd make `gapd.json` file in directory.
   2. `~/path/gapd install github.com/DiyLecko/goRecycleBuffer` then gapd install the package and write in `gapd.json`.
   3. `~/path/gapd install` then gapd install all package in `gapd.json`.

Thanks.
